/**
 * @module {controllers.lightstrip}
 *
 * Controller for Adafruit Digital RGB LED Waterproof Strip, http://www.adafruit.com/products/306
 * Provides a js API for writing individual pixels to that strip.
 *
 * Protocol is a Node port of the Adafruit Arduino C library.  Refer to that for description of the lightstrip protocol.
 *
 * To use:
 *  - call lightstrip.open(cb) to initialize the SPI writer.  You must run node as sudo to get access to the SPI driver.
 *  - call lightstrip.next() to start a new frame: start sending new RGB or HSV values down the strip
 *  - call lightstrip.rgb() or lightstrip.hsv() to send a single RGB or HSV pixel down the strip
 *
 * BACKPRESSURE:
 *   If you start writing to this lightstrip module faster than it can output the electrical signals, frames will start
 *   to be dropped.  This module automatically handles this backpressure relief; no need to worry about timing or
 *   events, just write away knowing that frames will be dropped if you write too quickly.  You'll get console log
 *   messages if this starts to happen.  Refer to the return value of next() to see whether your frame will be dropped
 *   or not.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NODES:
 *   Creates a Node WriteStream to the /dev/spidev0.0 file.  See various raspberry pi docs for how to
 *   enable the SPI driver, or just use the Adafruit rasbian distro.  You MUST start node with sudo to have write access
 *   to the SPI driver.
